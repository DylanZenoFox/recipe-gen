Option 1: Docker
- install docker (link instructions)
- build image (maybe write script)
    - from cuda ubtunti
    - copy requirements.txt
    - pip install requirements.txt
- run start_docker (write script)
   - option for nvidia docker versus docker
   - start_jupyter script inside

Option 2: Not Docker
- based on ubtuntu system with gpu stuff
- download cuda stuff
- check version of python=3.7
- python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
